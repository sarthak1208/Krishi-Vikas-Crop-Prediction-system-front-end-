<h1>FARMING TECHNIQUE FOR SUGARCANE</h1>
<p>The Brazilian sugarcane industry employs modern agronomic management practices to enhance productivity and protect the environment. Key features of Brazil's sustainable approach to cultivation and processing include:
Low Soil Erosion 
Brazilian sugarcane fields have relatively low levels of soil loss, due in part to the semi-perennial nature of sugarcane. The same plant will grow back many times after it is cut and its cane juice is extracted. In fact, sugarcane is typically only replanted every six or seven years.
The Brazilian industry also emphasizes farming techniques that preserve soil stability while yielding approximately 85 tons of sugarcane per hectare. Strategies include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>No-till production systems</li>
<li>Crop rotation with soybeans or peanuts</li>
<li>Green fertilization by planting cover crops such as Crotalaria juncea or using leftover sugarcane straw after mechanized harvesting as ground cover  </li>
</ul>
